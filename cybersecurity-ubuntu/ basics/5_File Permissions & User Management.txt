5 File Permissions & User Management  
Objective: Understand and modify Linux file permissions using chmod, chown, and manage users/groups. 
This is key for hardening systems and restricting access.  
Level: Intermediate

1. Create a folder for this exercise:  
	mkdir ~/exercise5_permissions  
	cd ~/exercise5_permissions  

2. Create a test file:  
	touch secret.txt  
	echo "Top Secret Info" > secret.txt  

3. Check current permissions:  
	ls -l secret.txt  

4. Remove read permission for group and others:  
	chmod go-r secret.txt  

5. Make the file executable only by the owner:  
	chmod u+x secret.txt  

6. Create a new user (you may need sudo):  
	sudo adduser testuser  

7. Check owner of the file:  
	ls -l secret.txt  

8. Change the ownership to the new user:  
	sudo chown testuser:testuser secret.txt  

9. Switch to the new user and try accessing the file:  
	su - testuser  
	cd /home/[your_user]/exercise5_permissions  
	cat secret.txt  

10. Exit testuser session:  
	exit  

11. Remove user (optional cleanup):  
	sudo deluser testuser
