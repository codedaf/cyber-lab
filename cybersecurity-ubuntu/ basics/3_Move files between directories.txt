3: Network and Process Monitoring
Objective: Observe running processes and check basic network connectivity.
Level: Beginner â€“ Intermediate
Main commands: htop, ping, top, ps aux, kill
Practice using the commands `mv`, `mkdir`, `ls`, `cd`, and `cat`.

1. Create a new working directory:
    mkdir practice3
    cd practice3

2. Create two subdirectories:
    mkdir folderA folderB

3. Create a file inside `folderA`:
    cd folderA
    echo "This file will be moved to folderB" > file3.txt
    cat file3.txt

4. Move the file to `folderB`:
    mv file3.txt ../folderB/

5. Verify that the file was moved correctly:
    cd ../folderB
    ls
    cat file3.txt

6. Return to your home directory (optional cleanup):
    cd ~

Optional Challenge:
-------------------
Try moving a whole folder:
    mv folderB ~/Desktop/
    (If Desktop does not exist, you can create and use another folder, like ~/practice3_backup/)
