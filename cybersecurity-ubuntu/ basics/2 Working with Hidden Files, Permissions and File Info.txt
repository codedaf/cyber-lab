Working with Hidden Files, Permissions and File Info

- Create hidden files, View file info, Change permissions
- Use useful commands like `ls -la`, `chmod`, `stat`


1. Go to your home directory : 			cd ~
2. Create a new folder called 'practice2' and enter imkdir practice2 cd practice2
3. Create a hidden file called '.secret.txt':    touch .secret.txt
4. List all files, including hidden ones:      	ls -la
5. Add text to '.secret.txt':		        echo "This is a hidden file." > .secret.txt
6. See the content of the hidden file:      	cat .secret.txt
7. Check file details:         			stat .secret.txt
8. Remove read permissions for others:     	chmod o-r .secret.txt
9. List the file again to see permission changes: ls -l
10. Try to read the file as another user (if available)
# (Optional step)

11. Restore full permissions for the owner: chmod u+rwx .secret.txt
12. Create a script file and make it executable: echo "echo Hello from Ubuntu!" > hello.sh
chmod +x hello.sh
./hello.sh

Expected Results:
- A hidden file named '.secret.txt' with text inside
- A script file 'hello.sh' that prints a message
- Understanding how file permissions work (read/write/execute)
